# Movie Database.

This is a React app that lets you search for movies and shows using the OMDb API.

## Demo

You may see a live demonstration of the program [here](https://juhorikhard.github.io/moviedatabase).

## Features:

- **Search for movies and shows**: Enter a movie or show title into the search bar to get results.
- **View details in a window**: When you click on a movie or show in the search results, a window will appear with specific information such as the title, year, rating, plot, and poster.
- **Responsive design**: The application is compatible with both desktop and mobile devices.

## Note:

This project was inspired by Tyler Potts' video tutorial titled "Build a Movie App with React". The original code has been tweaked and styled differently.
